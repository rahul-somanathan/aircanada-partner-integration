# Air Canada - Flight Routes API

This project implements a modular and extensible Flight Routes API based on the provided technical use case.

It exposes two endpoints:
- `/flightRoutes` â†’ retrieves flight offers between two airports.
- `/flightRoutesWithHotels` â†’ retrieves flight offers along with integrated hotel data near the destination.

The API is designed with clean separation of concerns and a flexible architecture, allowing for future enhancements such as adding new providers, caching, or additional endpoints.

## Live Deployment

The API is live and available here:

ðŸ‘‰ Base URL: [https://aircanada-partner-integration.onrender.com](https://aircanada-partner-integration.onrender.com)

### Endpoints

- [`GET https://aircanada-partner-integration.onrender.com/flightRoutes`](https://aircanada-partner-integration.onrender.com/flightRoutes)
- [`GET https://aircanada-partner-integration.onrender.com/flightRoutesWithHotels`](https://aircanada-partner-integration.onrender.com/flightRoutesWithHotels)
- [`GET https://aircanada-partner-integration.onrender.com/health`](https://aircanada-partner-integration.onrender.com/health) â†’ Health check
- [`https://aircanada-partner-integration.onrender.com/api-docs`](https://aircanada-partner-integration.onrender.com/api-docs) â†’ Swagger API documentation

## Why this architecture?

The goal was to implement an API that is:
- Easy to extend (e.g. add new providers, enrich responses)
- Secure and configurable (all config loaded from `.env`)
- Observable and debuggable (correlation IDs, global error handling)
- Maintainable and testable (layered architecture with clear roles)
- Ready to deploy in production environments (deployed to Render with CI/CD)

## Endpoints

### `GET /flightRoutes`

Fetches flight offers between origin and destination airports.

### `GET /flightRoutesWithHotels`

Fetches flight offers between origin and destination airports + hotel listings near destination.

### `GET /health`

Basic health check endpoint. Returns `{"status": "ok"}`.

## Production Readiness Features

The API implements key production readiness patterns:

- **Structured logging** â†’ Winston-based â†’ easy to parse in log systems
- **/health endpoint** â†’ for load balancer and monitoring checks
- **Request timeout** â†’ prevents hanging requests
- **Rate limiting** â†’ protects API from abuse (configurable via .env)
- **Standardized error responses** â†’ with correlationId for traceability
- **Global process error handlers** â†’ catch unhandled errors
- **All config externalized** â†’ no magic numbers in code
- **Deployed with CI/CD on Render**
